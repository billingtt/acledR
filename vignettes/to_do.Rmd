# Internal - To do

To do :
* Define if we are going to have the methodological pieces or not. My understanding is that no, but worth to discuss. 
* Find a way of breaking apart the API calls when they are going to be big. So far we have the idea of doing it through either region or year. 
  + My idea would be a pop-up / option, that if the dataset is expected to be quite big (~ the number of rows that we now break the function), then it        breaks it by year. 
* Define if we want to add more options to the acled_api or if we leave the ... argument with the example in the vignitte. 
* Final checks to all documentation (perhaps methodology should do that?)
* Check CRAN requirements
* What do we do with the name? (if we are in CRAN already then it would be no problem)
* What do we do with the deleted_api ?
