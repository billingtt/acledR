Welcome to ACLED's official R package! With this package we want to bring you an even more convenient way to access ACLED data, building on top of our existing API. 

In this repo you can find the source code of the package, as well as the documentation. You can also visit https://acled.github.io/acledR/ for more information and walkthroughs on how to use the package.


# Overview

This package provides tools to extract and manipulate data from the [Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/). 

To access ACLED data, please register an account at [developer.acleddata.com](developer.acleddata.com). 

* You can visit our [guide](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew//wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ACLED_Access-Guide_October-2020.pdf) on how to easily set up your ACLED account. 
* We recommend you to save your ACLED API Key in an R object so you can easily re-use your key. 

## Installation (for private repo)

Since the package repo is currently private, you need to tell R and Github that you're a collaborator. To do so, you first create a Github personal access token (PAT). You can set this to expire after a certain time (the default) or be permanent. We can initiate this process internally via:

```{r, eval=F}
# install.packages("usethis") if not installed already
# create personal access token - this should redirect to your github page where you can copy the token
usethis::create_github_token()
```

After you've copied the PAT from the browser and saved it somewhere safe, return to R and run this, which will store the PAT locally.

```{r, eval=F}
# paste the token where it says YourPAT
credentials::set_github_pat("YourPAT")
# if you run this, it should print your token; if not we've failed
Sys.getenv("GITHUB_PAT")
```

Now you can install the package and it will automatically locate your PAT.

```{r, eval=F}
# install from github
devtools::install_github("ACLED/acledR")
```


## Installation (for public use) 

The package is on the process to get submited to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). In the meantime, you can install the package from Github.
```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("ACLED/acledR") ## if you are interested in a particular branch, please add a 'ref' argument. 
```

Once the package is uploaded to CRAN, you can install it with the following command:
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("acledR")
```
