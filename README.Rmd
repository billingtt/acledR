Welcome to ACLED's official R package! This package simplifies access to the data via ACLED's API. It also provides convenient functions for making common ACLED data transformations. See dtacled.github.io/acledR for more information and tutorials on how to use the package.


# Overview

This package provides tools to extract and manipulate data from the [Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/). 

To access ACLED data, please register an account at [developer.acleddata.com](developer.acleddata.com). 

* You can visit our [guide](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew//wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ACLED_Access-Guide_October-2020.pdf) on how to easily set up your ACLED account. 
* We recommend you to save your ACLED API Key in an R object so you can easily re-use your key. 


## Installation

The package will be reviewed and available on CRAN shortly. In the meantime, you can install the package from Github:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("ACLED/acledR")
```
