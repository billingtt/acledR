\title{Calculate actor concentration indices from ACLED data}
\usage{
acled_actor_concentration(
  events,
  method = "Effective actors",
  acled_dataframe = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{Vector of outcomes per actor (i.e., event counts or fatalities), or ACLED data frame.}

\item{method}{Index method. Default is "Effective actors", which is an Inverse Simpson Index. "Concentration" calculates a Herfindahlâ€“Hirschman Index.}

\item{acled_dataframe}{Boolean. True or False statement on whether events is a dataframe. Defaults to True}
}
\value{
Returns a data.frame of the index value (`eff_actors` or `concentration`, depending on the method specified), number of unique actors, and average number of events per actor.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# These examples show the use of this function with simulated event counts from 5 actors
#library(acledR)

# In the first case, each actor is attributed the same event count (10 events)
#df1 <- data.frame(actor = 1:5,
#               event_count = c(10, 10, 10, 10, 10))

# Using the "Effective actors" method, 5 actors, each responsible for 10 events,
# returns the value of 5 for `eff_actors`
#acled_actor_concentration(df1$event_count, method = "Effective actors")

#Using the "Concentration" method, the same data returns a value of 0.2 for `concentration`
#acled_actor_concentration(df1$event_count, method = "Concentration")

# In the next case, 1 actor is responsible for 10 events, while the other 4
# are responsible for only 1 event each
#df2 <- data.frame(actor = 1:5,
              event_count = c(10, 1, 1, 1, 1))

#The "Effective actors" method returns a value of 1.88 `eff_actors`
#acled_actor_concentration(df2$event_count, method = "Effective actors")

#And the "Concentration" method returns a value of 0.53 for `concentration`
#acled_actor_concentration(df2$event_count, method = "Concentration")

#Finally, when 2 actors are responsible for 10 events each and the other 3 actors only 1 event
#df3 <- data.frame(actor = 1:5,
              event_count = c(10, 10, 1, 1, 1)
#The "Effective actors" method returns a value of around 2.61 `eff_actors`
#acled_actor_concentration(df3$event_count, method = "Effective actors")

#And the "Concentration" method returns a value of 0.38 for `concentration`
#acled_actor_concentration(df3$event_count, method = "Concentration")
