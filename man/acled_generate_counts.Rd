\usage{
acled_generate_counts(
  data,
  event_type = NULL,
  unit_id,
  time_id,
  time_target,
  start_date = NULL,
  end_date = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame. ACLED data}

\item{event_type}{Event types to include. If more than one event type is included, event counts per type and the total number of events is returned. If NULL, all event types are returned.}

\item{unit_id}{string. Unit variable (e.g., country, region, admin1, etc.).}

\item{time_id}{string. Temporal variable, usually event_date.}

\item{time_target}{string. Target temporal unit (e.g. week, month, year).}

\item{start_date}{date. Earliest date to include (yyyy-mm-dd).}

\item{end_date}{date. Latest date to include (yyyy-mm-dd).}

\item{add_unit_ids}{string. Option to add in units with no events throughout the time period of interest. To include hierarchical unique_id (e.g., country and admin1) add them separated by ";".}

\item{fatalities_count}{logical. If TRUE, it will return fatalities counts INSTEAD of event counts.}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble grouped by unit_id.

### General example ###
# Request all events from a few countries
df_events <- acled_api(countries = c("Brazil", "Mexico", "Argentina"),
                       start_date = "2022-01-01",
                       end_date = "2022-07-30",
                       monadic = FALSE,
                       acled_access = TRUE,
                       prompt = FALSE)

# Generate event counts at the admin1-month level
df_counts <- acled_generate_counts(data = df_events,
                             unit_id = "admin1",
                             time_id = "event_date",
                             time_target = "month")



### add_unit_ids example ###
# Request riots in the United States and Canada between January 1st and January 30th 2020
df_riots <- acled_api(countries = c("United States", "Canada"),
                       start_date = "2022-01-01",
                       end_date = "2022-01-30",
                       event_types = "Riots",
                       monadic = FALSE,
                       acled_access = TRUE,
                       prompt = FALSE)

# Notice that there are no riot events in Canada over this period
table(df_riots$country)

# Generate weekly riot counts
# Use the add_unit_ids paramater so Canada is assigned 0 events each week
# If add_unit_ids was not included, only weekly counts for the United States
# would be returned since Canada had no riots in the requested time period

df_counts_riots <- acled_generate_counts(data = df_riots,
                                   unit_id = "country",
                                   event_type = "Riots",
                                   time_id = "event_date",
                                   time_target = "week",
                                   fatalities_count = FALSE,
                                   add_unit_ids = "Canada")
